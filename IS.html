                    <p align="justify">The decline of Malaysia's Ringgit creates ripple effects across various sectors, affecting both businesses and individuals. Rising costs of imports lead to inflation and reduced purchasing power for citizens. At the same time, businesses face increased operational expenses, while Malaysia’s global competitiveness is weakened by its shrinking trade surplus and reduced foreign investments. These issues highlight the broader economic strain that the weakening Ringgit places on Malaysia’s economy and its citizens.</p>
